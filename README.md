<p>
  The basic concept of this project, <b>Food Waste Management</b>, is to collect excess or leftover food from donors such as hotels, restaurants, marriage halls, and individuals, and distribute it to needy people.
</p>

<h2>Tools and Technologies</h2>
<ul>
  <li><b>Frontend:</b> HTML, CSS, JavaScript</li>
  <li><b>Backend:</b> PHP</li>
  <li><b>Web Server:</b> XAMPP</li>
  <li><b>Database:</b> MySQL</li>
</ul>

<h2>System Modules</h2>
<ul>
  <li>User</li>
  <li>Admin</li>
  <li>Delivery</li>
</ul>

<h3>User Module</h3>
<p>
  The User module is designed for people who wish to donate their excess or leftover food to help reduce wastage.
  Users can register, log in, and donate food by specifying the type and quantity. 
  The system matches their donation with the nearest needy people or organizations. 
  Users can also view their past donations. 
  All donation details are forwarded to the Admin module for further processing.

<h3>Admin Module</h3>
<p>
  The Admin module is for trusts, NGOs, and charities registered on the platform. 
  Admins manage the food distribution process, receive information about donations, and list them for NGOs and charities to choose from. 
  Admins can view and manage the list of donations, including type and quantity. 
  NGOs and charities can select the donations they need and request a pickup through the Delivery module. 
  Admins are also responsible for tracking requests and recording which organizations have collected which donations.

<h3>Delivery Module</h3>
<p>
  The Delivery Person module is for individuals who wish to participate in the donation process by providing pickup and delivery services. 
  Delivery personnel can register on the platform and view the pickup and drop-off details for each request. 
  They ensure that donated food reaches NGOs and charities safely.
